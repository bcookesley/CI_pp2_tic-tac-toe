# Project Goals
Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses in the UK) is a familiar game that we all remember from our childhood. Here, you can challenge a truly great opponent - the computer. The computer will randomly pick boxes to put a "O" in and the user will play "X" and then strategy will ensue. 
The object of the game is to get a row of three "X's" or three "O's" in any direction and once the user or the computer has achieved this, the game is over. Keep track of your score and keep playing the computer until you win, or hopefully, win all the time.

# Design 

### Design choices 

This game was designed with simplicity in mind. As this is a classic, retro, easy to play game - the design should reflect this. Not having an overly complicated design or an overwhelming amount of features keeps the design of this game simple and intuitive - and more importantly, easy to play.

### Colour 

### Font 

Fonts used for this website were used from Google fonts. A choice for Quicksand was made with a backup of sans-serif as this conveyed and inkeeping with the simple, user-friendly design of the site. 

### Layout 

The sites layout is designed in a simple fashion that is user friendly and intuitive. When arriving at the site you are greeted with a simple start oage that includes some basic information about the game and a button to enter into the game. The site consists of 3 pages.

    - A main page with 3 separate views:
        - A start page with some basic game instructions and information
        - A game page featuring a game board to play the game
        - A winnning page that alerts the user of the winnner of the game
    - A contact page 
    - 404 page
