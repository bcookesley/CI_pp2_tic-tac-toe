# <strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong>

(Developer: Ben Cookesley)




Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses in the UK) is a familiar game that we all remember from our childhood. Here, you can challenge a truly great opponent - the computer. The computer will randomly pick boxes to put a "O" in and the user will play "X" and then strategy will ensue. 
The object of the game is to get a row of three "X's" or three "O's" in any direction and once the user or the computer has achieved this, the game is over. Keep track of your score and keep playing the computer until you win, or hopefully, win all the time.
