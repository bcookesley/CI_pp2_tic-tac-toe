/* Almost all of this code was copied from an external source on Youtube. All credits and links to this video are in the README.md file.
While a simple game - my JavaScript progression and understanding were not good enough to make a game such as this. Due to the amount of 
time I had to complete this unit and hand my project in I had to find how others had written and coded this game (there are many!).

I typed this all out myself and I have watched, written and rewritten lots of this code. I have also added some of my own, but this was also largely inspired and taken from 
the Love Maths walkthrough project.
