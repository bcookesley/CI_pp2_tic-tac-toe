        <p class="game-rules">A classic game of Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts & Crosses in the UK). Can you beat the computer
            at this classic game? Simply connect up 3 X's in a row in any direction to win the game. Every time you win
            or lose the tally will keep track of your score, so do keep playing until you beat the computer, or be a
            strategic genius and keep taking the computer down! Remember to push to "New Game" button to start a new
            game. The tally will keep track of your score for each new game and you can refresh your scores by
            refreshing the page. Enjoy!
